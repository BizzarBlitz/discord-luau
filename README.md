# Discord-Luau
A Luau discord API wrapper. This is the 'refactor' branch, where I take what i've learned from my first impl, and create a better library from what i've learned..!

## Project status

I'm activly working on this branch, ideally I have two days per week to commit/work on this project, so it's not going to be a quick library, but it'll be something!

:)
